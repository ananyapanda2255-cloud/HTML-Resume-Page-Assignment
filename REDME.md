##  What I Learned

In this project, I learned about:

1. Semantic HTML5 tags
2. How to structure a resume using sections
3. Clean and readable HTML code
4. Using lists and tables for formatting

### Semantic tags used

- `<header>` - For top section with name and title
- `<main>` - For the main resume content
- `<section>` - For organizing different parts of the resume
- `<article>` - For individual projects
- `<table>` - For experience and education
- `<address>` - For contact information
- `<footer>` - For copyright
- `<hr>` - For separation between sections

##  Project Steps

### Step 1: Set up the basic HTML structure
- Created an `index.html` file
- Added the basic HTML5 document structure
- Included meta tags (`charset`, `viewport`)

### Step 2: Added semantic sections
- Header section (Name + role)
- About Me section
- Skills section (List)
- Experience section (Table)
- Projects section (Articles)
- Education section (Table)
- Contact section (Address)
- Footer section
